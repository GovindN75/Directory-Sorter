# Directory-Sorter
 
I made this when I got triggered looking through my downloads folder. However, you can use it to clean up different directories as well. The requirements for this bot is the os module and the shutil module. Both of these should be pre installed. If not go ahead and copy these commands into your terminal/cmd/powershell or whatever shell you use: <br>
pip install os <br>
pip install shutil
